**Abstract**

Improvements in food production and security are considered priority challenges for agriculture in the coming decades due increasing population (9 billion by 2050), climate change, and consumer demand for high quality products. Developing agricultural strategies that respond to human protection and animal welfare with low impact on the environment is of key importance. Italy is among the European nations with highest presence of organic agriculture and in particular in the horticultural sector the organic production increased 60% in the last 5 years (Eurostat). The horticultural sector represents today a leading organic sector with increases in the number of companies in the last five years of approximately 50%.
Among the horticultural crops, Rocket (rucola) showed a huge increase in production in the last decade, with an increase in the income of 300% in the last 10 years. Rocket is a food with high nutritional value because is each of micronutrients and antioxidants. This characteristic has increased the consumer request of rucola in the European Market. Rucola is historically produced in Italy and is present in the Italian diet. Italy still represent one of the major producers of Rucola in Europe.
To decrease the impact of the agriculture on the environment is necessary to improve the agricultural practices to ensure a higher sustainability. The organic agriculture is the best suitable for this purpose however most of the cultivar available were not selected for this type of growth practices. Therefore, there is now the need to breed varieties that are most suitable for organic growth regime.  
The generation of new varieties with higher yield, resilience to the changing environmental conditions and resistance to emerging pathogens will provide the Italian growers highly performing rucola able to compete on the global market.

**Goal of the Project.**


Identification of new rucola varieties with higher performance.

**Research activities**


The commercial Rucola belongs to two different species the annual Eruca Sativa and the perennial Dypotaxis tenuifola. The perennial is cultivated more broadly at the moment. 
To generate new genetic variation in the Dyplotaxis cultivar we will use an approach of chemical mutagenesis (EMS). This technic allows to introduce point mutation in the genome and the resulting products are suitable for both conventional and organic agriculture. Moreover, in the specific case of rucola, where intraspecies cross is problematic due to impair in the chromosome number, this approach will allow to implement desirable traits of the annual specie to the perennial.   
The new varieties will be selected for a delay in the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase that will allow an increase in the number of leaves produced, therefore increasing the plant productivity. The selected lines are then analysed for resistance to pathogens and abiotic stresses. 
The following pathogens will be tested: Fusarium oxysporum, Xanthomonas campestris and Hyaloperonospora sp. These pathogens are frequently present in rucola fields and represent an increase in lost in productivity.  The abiotic stress taken in consideration will be heat stress, salt stress and drought tolerance which are most frequent in the area where rucola is cultivated. Finally, we will also take in consideration lines with changes in leaf morphology that can allow to expand the rucola market. The new varieties will be ultimately tested in the field test the overall performance in organic growth practices.  

**Deliverables**

New rucola varieties with higher productivity and resistance to pathogens.

Design of molecular markers associated with desired traits to be used in assisted breeding programs.  

In the project is planned a period abroad of one year at Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research an institute leader in the field of genetics and developmental biology  in the Dir. Prof. Dr. G. Coupland group a genetist expert in the regulation of plant reproduction where the rucola lines with a prolonged vegetative phase will be identified. 
The project includes also a period of 3 months at SARA ENViMOB a biotech company where the bioinformatic analysis will be executed and a period of 3 months at Altamura OP a farm that cultivates rucola where the new varieties will be tested in the field.
