<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Various defense methods have been studied and developed to protect crops against pathogens. 
To date, the most effective ones are all based on the use of chemical pesticides (e.g. permethrins, strobilurins, triazoles and imidazoles) 
which have a serious impact on the environment, on animal and human health (IARC and EFSA data) and 
on economic sustainability of production processes (FAO data) and on the onset of resistance in the populations of 
pathogens (EPPO data). The European regulation 128/09/EC was adopted in 2015 and it regulats the 
use of pesticides and allows the purchase and use of these compounds only after the issuance of a permit. 
With this legislation, de facto, various pesticides have been eliminated from the market although they guaranteed 
farmers optimal production performance and, conseguently, a good profit.
The 128/09/EC law banned by several pesticides of synthesis and therefore alternatives to these product are needed. 
Products of natural origin  with little impact on the environment and lower toxicity for animals and humans are better sustainable.
Since long time, biopesticides have been attractive alternatives to synthetic pesticides for pathogen management. 
Many scientific publications document the bioactivity of microbial and plant derivatives towards pathogens. 
Although a big effort is/was made by the scientific community to identify biopesticied, to date, there is little prospect for the commercial development 
of new products. Many factors appear to limit the success of biopesticides, like regulatory barriers and 
the availability of competing chemicals (newer products, fermentation products) that are cost-effective and relatively 
safe compared to their predecessors. To date the alternatives - real - are based on a limited set of “BIO” compounds,
i.e. biostimulants, resistance inducers and biopesticides such as chitosan and Trichoderma (eg commercial Trichodex®).
This project aims to develop biostimulants, resistance inducers and biological control agents on a pre-commercial scale 
usable on primary crops such as wheat, olive and tomato. These product need to be derived by natual products 
in order to facilitate the green transition. These product should be safe and therefore not harmful for soils biodiversity 
and phytobiomes, and avoide the deterioration of agroecosystems.
In particular, by means of omic approaches, the microbiome of suppressive soils will be characterized in search of 
microorganisms that are able to activate the defenses of wheat, olive trees and tomatoes. The formulations will be 
tested in the field against a wide spectrum of pathogens (eg Xylella fastidiosa, Fusarium) which represent, to date, 
the greatest threat to the productive capacity 
of the South for durum wheat, olive trees and tomatoes. Furthermore, in this project, new compounds deriving from 
epi/endophyte bacteria and fungi of these plants and from the microbiome of suppressive soils will be purified, 
characterized and used in experimental fields, capable of inducing their natural defenses, improving their productive 
capacity and have a biocidal effect on pathogens. The project plans to study the entire supply chain 
- from crops to products: eg. wine, oil, derivatives of durum wheat flours - characterizing their safety aspects 
(eg mycotoxins, toxicity of biofungicide residues) and quality (nutraceutical aspects).

The project includes a period of 6 months each in company reported below:
- AGRIGES SRL - Nutrizione Speciale per L'Agricoltura Biologica e Integrata
- Samagri S.r.l.

**The appointed person will have to teach for about 200 hours each year** 

**The project requires that the selected candidate will spend between 6 and 12 months at the School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Laboratory of structure, function and host control of the plant microbiota**

***Requirements:***

At least one Post-Doc in one of the following fields:
- plant pathology,
- botanic
- plant physiology
- microbiology

Italian candidates need to have a Post-Doc in one of the fields above mentioned for at least 6 months
