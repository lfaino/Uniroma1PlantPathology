Globalization and climate change are reshaping the landscape and the distribution of plant pests. This trend represents a threat to natural and cultivated environments, to agricultural and forestry production, to ecosystems and to biodiversity in the territory of the European Union. Over the past decade, the EU has faced several large-scale infectious outbreaks of new plant pests, which have a significant impact. A very explanatory case is represented by Xylella fastidiosa (Xf), which since 2013, starting from Italy, has been intercepted in several European countries. According to forecast models, the current distribution of Xf in Europe is very limited compared to the large extent of the areas climatically suitable for the establishment of the bacterium. It emerged that the potential distribution of Xf seems to be conditioned by the minimum winter temperatures, being the cold the main deterrent of the multiplication of the bacterium in the plant host. Regarding areas with extremely high temperatures in the summer, the potential dynamics of Xf remain uncertain, as the impact of extreme heat on Xf is poorly understood. However, evidence reported in Puglia (Italy) on olive trees, highlighted the inadmissibility of the suspension of effective treatments in containing the bacterial population in planta during the summer period, as a resumption of bacterial multiplication and symptoms of the disease is observed. From these observations it emerges that climate change, with a consequent generalized increase in minimum winter temperatures and summer temperatures, could significantly alter the distribution of areas suitable for the settlement and spread of Xf.
Another important aspect is the impact on the territory of harmful organisms such as Xf. In 2013, the year of the first report of the disease, an estimated 8,000 hectares of Apulian olive groves were affected by the bacterium. By December 2014, the known infected area had almost tripled; it has recently been calculated that the speed of the advancing front of the infection is about 10 km/year and that the invasion of Xf in Puglia probably did not start in 2013, but about five years earlier. The consequences of this settlement in the Apulian territory were devastating, severely affecting the local and national economy. Olive trees are symbolic trees for the region and olive groves are part of the local landscape and cultural heritage. The loss of ancient trees has affected the cultural heritage and attractiveness of the region. The landscape, characterized by expanses of olive trees such as those of the "Piana degli Ulivi monumentali", has been completely distorted and currently there are expanses of dried and mutilated plants. Many family farms have been hit, whose damages are difficult to monetize. In the affected areas, the production and handling of plants for planting was regulated, causing a decline in the income of nursery production. These situations are changing the socio-economic and landscape structure of the heel of Italy.
In this context, the EU has prepared a coordinated and harmonized preparatory strategy to protect agriculture, the environment and the economy from these dangerous harmful organisms.
In particular, the EU phytosanitary legislation was updated with the Regulation (EU) 2016/2031, which was adopted in December 2019. Among the measures included, a list of more dangerous organisms was established. For each of dangerous organism, Member States will have to carry out annual surveys, draw up and update an emergency plan, carry out simulations, dissemination to the citizen and adopt an action plan for the eradication of harmful organisms already present in the area.
In relation to these EU objectives, the PhD project will be focused on the development of an innovative diagnostic system that combines molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques that allows to combine sustainability, safety and technological innovation.
The innovative diagnostic system will be based on the amplification of key genes for the identification of strains and differentiation of bacterial subspecies or phylotypes, combined with sequencing analysis with Nanopore technology and ad hoc bioinformatics pipeline that use data stored in online databases. This approach will significantly improve the sensitivity and specificity for an early diagnosis in order to promptly identify new bacterial microorganisms and / or new biotypes even in asymptomatic conditions. The validation of this system during the PhD thesis will be carried out on different plant matrices (e.g. seeds, fruits, leaves, branches, soil, etc.) in controlled conditions and on the territory, in combination with several priority bacterial pathogens for Italy and the EU (Pantoea stewartii, Xylella fastidiosa, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Xanthomonas citri, Ralstonia solanacearum). The final objective of the PhD project is the development of a diagnostic methodology that can be used at the entry points (ports, airports and customs) that are simple and easy to use by phytosanitary inspectors from all over Europe.
Due to the enlargement of the distribution area of pathogenic population, resulting from climate change and global trade, the goal of this project is to be prepared for the future challenges with rapid, effective and robust protocols. This allow:
- to verify the variation of the biodiversity of the pathogenic populations;
- to face the invasion of priority pathogens in the EU;
- to guide the community policies to prevent epidemics for the conservation of ecosystem biodiversity reducing the impact of climate change.


The development of this new technology will take place with the involvement of end users (i.e. Regional Phytosanitary Services, National Reference Laboratories for plant diseases).
The activities of RI & SS that are implemented in the project aim to achieve important industrial objectives that enhance in terms of added value the priority actions to be taken in Italy and in the EU member states for the protection of plants from the entry and development of priority pathogens, promoting the sustainability and biodiversity of ecosystems
