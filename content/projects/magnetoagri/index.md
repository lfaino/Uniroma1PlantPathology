The bioengineering project  [''Magnetopriming for sustainable agriculture''](https://sites.google.com/view/magnetoagri), funded by the Lazio Region '' Research Groups 2020'' program, sees the participation of the DEB and DEIM of the University of Tuscia (lead Institution) and La Sapienza University. It aims to unravel at the molecular level the effect of priming triggered by magnetic fields in tomato plants for disease protection. The "priming" in plants is a physiological state caused by exposure to stimuli for short periods and / or at low concentrations that alerts them to respond to future stress. By offering to the plant a permanent and long-lasting protection, magnetopriming can offer a promising strategy for sustainable disease management in the field. The first results obtained showed that the magnetic fields generated by a prototype have a growth promoting and increase defense effect and defense against fungal diseases. The project aims to promote the sustainable development of the agri-food chain on the regional territory. The ultimate goal is to provide a magnetic field generator device for workers in the agricultural sector, cheap, easy to use and absolutely safe for human health
