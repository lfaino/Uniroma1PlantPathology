The maize pathogen *Fusarium verticillioides* causes huge economic losses per year due to the production of fumonisins. 
*Fusarium verticillioides* ITEM 10027 (*Fv10027*) isolated in Italy shows a reduced fumonisins synthesis when compared to 
the *F. verticillioides* reference strain 7600 (*Fv7600*). Although the difference in fumonisins production, the pathogenicity 
tests on maize stalk did not show any difference in infection levels. Additionally, using knock-out mutant in 
FUM1 gene did not show any compromised virulence in stalk rot assay. To better understand *Fv* virulence, 
the genome of *Fv10027* was sequenced and assembled. Comparative genomics between *Fv7600* and *Fv10027* showed a difference 
in genome size of about 1.4 Mb despite 99% nucleotide identity. Genome assembly of *Fv10027* showed that two mini-chromosomes 
of about 1 Mb and 750 Kb were unique to *Fv10027* while a mini-chromosome of about 400Kb to *Fv7600*. To determine the presence 
of these mini chromosomes in the Italian *Fv* population, 24 strains, sampled in the Po valley, were sequenced; 
presence/absence analysis showed that only three *Fv* strains had those chromosomes. The analysis of *Fv10027* dispensable 
chromosomes showed an enrichment of secreted proteins and a higher level of repetitive elements. Intriguingly, 
BLAST analysis on the *Fv10027* proteome showed that proteins codified on mini chromosomes have the best identity to *F. oxysporum*
proteins located at dispensable chr3 and chr6. Moreover, synonyms substitution analysis suggests that mini chromosomes of 
*F. verticilloides* were not probably acquired through a horizontal chromosomal transfer from *F. oxysporum* but rather 
originated before the split of the two species.


**The aim connect to this project are multiple:**
- Understand the role of mini-chromosomes in the interaction with Maize
- Understand the role on mycotoxins in the interaction with the host
- figure out which are the molecular shift that make the pathogen necrotrophic after a biotrophic phase
