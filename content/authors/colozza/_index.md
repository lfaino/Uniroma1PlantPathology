Deborah Colozza graduated (Bachelor’s degree) in “Agro-industrial Biotechnology” at the University of Rome "La Sapienza" in 2019 and in 2021 graduated for the Master’s degree in “Cell Biology and Technologies” at the same university. She is now attending her PhD program in Environmental and Evolutionary biology at the University of Rome “La Sapienza”.
Her studies focus on the plant reproduction and the genetic improvement of Italian Rocket focusing on the the molecular mechanisms that drive plant transition from the vegetative to the reproductive developmental phase in response to endogenous and environmental signals for the identification of new rucola varieties with higher productivity and resistance to pathogens.
