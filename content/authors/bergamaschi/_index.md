Since October 2019 to September 2020 he carried out one year research fellowship at the Research Center for Plant Pathology, CREA -DC, in Rome within the EFSA project about the monitoring of the quarantine fungus Phyllosticta citricarpa (causal agent of Citrus Black Spot; CBS) reported for the first time in Italy in Trebisacce (CS).
Since October 2020 to December 2021 he obtained a new research fellowship at the Research Center for Plant Pathology, CREA -DC, in Rome within the EFSA project to continue the monitoring of the quarantine fungus Phyllosticta citricarpa and within the CERES-BIO project about the study of eco-sustainable alternatives to copper to prevent common bunt. 
At present, he started a PhD at the University of Rome “Sapienza” with a project that aims to study the “Kiwifruit Vine Decline” with NGS techniques and to found an environmentally friendly product to managed the affected plants.
