Valeria Crosara graduated cum laude in Ecobiology in 2021 at the Sapienza University of Rome, with a thesis based on the study of the effect of climate change on the trophic network structure of the benthic community in the three characteristic habitats of Antarctic marine coasts, using stable isotope analysis. 
In 2021 she also completed the "Honours Program", a program that provides motivated and deserving students access to in-depth cultural activities and facilitates their integration more broadly into scientific research. For this reason, she moved to the Physics laboratory of the University of Parma where, with Professor Michele Bellingeri, she learned new theoretical and practical notions of graph analysis and their applications to ecological, biological and social systems.
She is a member of the Italian Society of Ecology. 
Now she is starting his PhD in Botany at the same university. Currently her studies focus on the development of an innovative diagnostic methodology for the detection and identification of plant pathogens using molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques.
