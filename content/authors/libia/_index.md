Carla Libia Corrado graduated with honors in Agricultural and Environmental Biotechnology from the University of Perugia in 2019.  She carried out a thesis work in plant pathology, focused on the pathogenicity and virulence of bacterial plant pathogens that in 2020 allowed her to obtain a research fellowship at the Research Center for Plant Pathology, CREA -DC, in Rome where she joined the research group of plant virology. There, she first collaborated with the virology activities of EURLs and then, in 2021, she was involved in the diagnostic activities of the plant virology laboratory, in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. Currently, she started a PhD in Plant Pathology at the University of Rome "Sapienza", with a project on the interaction between plant viruses, plants, insect vectors and the use of biostimulants.
