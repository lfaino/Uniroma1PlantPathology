Giovanna Gramegna graduated cum laude in Applied Cellular Biology at the University of Rome “Sapienza” in 2010. In 2014 she obtained her PhD in Botanical Sciences in the same university, with a thesis on the mechanisms of perception of a class of plant endogenous elicitors in Arabidopsis. In 2015 she moved to Brazil, where she worked as a post doc in the laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Plants at the University of São Paulo, focusing her studies on tomato fruit nutritional quality improvement. In 2019 she moved to the University of L’Aquila where she investigated the use of microalgae for waste recycling and production of biofuel. In 2020 she returned to Sapienza University in the Plant Physiology laboratory studying the key aspects that underlie the growth-defense trade-off in Arabidopsis.
Since December 2021 she is researcher at the Environmental Biology Department. Her research interests focus on improving plant resistance to pathogens, with particular regard to the use of microorganisms and their products against the main pathogens of crops.
