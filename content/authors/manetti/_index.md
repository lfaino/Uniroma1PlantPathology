Giuliano Manetti graduated in the master’s degree of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at University of Tuscia in 2019, with a final experimental thesis about agronomic evaluation of some hop varieties (Humulus lupulus L.) in central Italy.
In March of the same year, he attended a traineeship at the research center NIAB EMR, in the United Kingdom, working on verticillium wilt of hops.
In June 2020 he won a research fellowship at CREA-DC of Rome, studying diagnostic methods, infection pathways and control strategies of some fungal pathogens of wheat. 
He is currently a PhD student at the Environmental Biology Department of the University of Rome “La Sapienza”, with a project that regards investigations on serious decline of olive trees due to fungal microorganisms in Apulia region.
