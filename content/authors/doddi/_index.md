Andrea Doddi recently graduated cum laude in Cell Biology and Technology at the University of Rome "Sapienza". In 2019 he attended a traineeship at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research working on Plant Physiology. During his Master course he moved in the Plant Pathology laboratory of the University of Rome "Sapienza" were he was involved in a project regarding a putative effector in *Fusarium oxysporum*. He spent part of the Master degree abroad at the University of Amsterdam in the lab of Prof. Martijn Rep. He is now starting as a PhD in a project involved in the investigation of new effectors in *Fusarium oxysporum*
